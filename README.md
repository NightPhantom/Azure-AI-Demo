# Azure AI Demo

## Usage
Each tab contains a demo of a feature or set of features of Azure AI Services.
1. Click on the feature that you want to demo.
1. If the endpoint and key for the service that the feature relies on hasn't been configured yet, see [configure endpoints and keys](#configure-endpoints-and-keys).
1. (optional) If the feature uses an image, you can click the ![Open file](Azure%20AI%20Demo/Resources/OpenFile.png) button to pick your own image, or you can leave it as is to use the sample images included in this repository.
1. Click the ![Analyze/Detect/Read/Test](Azure%20AI%20Demo/Resources/Play.png) button to run the demo.
1. After processing the request, the results will be shown below the button and overlaid on the image if applicable.

## Configure endpoints and keys
In each tab you will see a key button ![Key input](Azure%20AI%20Demo/Resources/EditKey.png) on the upper right corner. Click this button to launch a dialog where you can enter the endpoint and key relevant to the feature being demoed in that tab.
